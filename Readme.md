# Plain JS Plugin template

## Quick start

1. `yarn` - to install dependencies
2. `yarn start` - to start development mode - rebuild on file modifications
3. update your `plugin-manifest.json` file to contain the production URL and other plugin information
4. `yarn build` - to build plugins

## AI agent guidance

This template includes workspace instructions and skills for GitHub Copilot:

- [Copilot instructions](.github/copilot-instructions.md) define the repository architecture, Flotiq API and credential rules, and the template-demo cleanup checklist.
- [`flotiq-plugins`](.github/skills/flotiq-plugins/SKILL.md) guides agents through adding UI elements to CTD grids and forms, selecting Flotiq events, using `FormApi` and schema modals, configuring plugin settings, updating manifest permissions, integrating APIs, and installing/publishing the plugin.

The skill can be discovered automatically from a matching request or invoked as `/flotiq-plugins`. Its focused references cover events and UI placement, manifest and API access, forms and settings, credential handling, and installation.

## Dev environment

Dev environment is configured to use:

- `prettier` - best used with automatic format on save in IDE, remember to run `yarn format` before commiting changes
- `eslint` - it is built into both `start` and `build` commands

## Output

The plugins are built into a single `dist/index.js` file. The manifest is copied to `dist/plugin-manifest.json` file.

## Deployment

<!-- TO DO -->

## Loading the plugin

**Warning:** While developing, you can use `https://localhost:3053/plugin-manifest.json` address to load the plugin manifest. Make sure your browser trusts the local certificate on the latter, to be able to use it e.g. with `https://editor.flotiq.com`

### URL

**Hint**: You can use localhost url from development mode `https://localhost:3053/index.js`

1. Open Flotiq editor
2. Open Chrome Dev console
3. Execute the following script
   ```javascript
   FlotiqPlugins.loadPlugin('plugin-id', '<URL TO COMPILED JS>');
   ```
4. Navigate to the view that is modified by the plugin

### Directly

1. Open Flotiq editor
2. Open Chrome Dev console
3. Paste the content of `dist/index.js`
4. Navigate to the view that is modified by the plugin

### Deployment

**Hint**: You can use localhost url from development mode `https://localhost:3053/plugin-manifest.json`

1. Open Flotiq editor
2. Add a new plugin and paste the URL to the hosted `plugin-manifest.json` file
3. Navigate to the view that is modified by the plugin
